        Building a website is an exercise of willpower. The bells and whistles
        of the design process are tempting to focus on, but compelling content
        is what makes a website work for your business. There are few pieces of
        content on your website that are more compelling than your mission,
        vision, values, and team. And all of these elements are typically found
        on the About page of your website.
